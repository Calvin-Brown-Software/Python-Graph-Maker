Python-Graph-Maker
A program written in Python that will graph out equations.


So far it supports:

1.)   Direct Equations

2.)   Linear Equations

3.)   Inverse Variations

4.)   Quadratic Equations

5.)   Custom Formulas


Currently there are some bugs with the program, they may be fixed in the future if development is continued.


Place Dot.gif and Graphi.gif directly into your harddrive. These are the required images that the program will load.
